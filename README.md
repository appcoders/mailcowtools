## Mailcow tools - simple tools that use the mailcow API

Currently there a the following tools:

- [addMailboxes](https://github.com/appcoders/mailcowtools/releases/tag/addmailboxes-1.0.1)
- [updateQuota](https://github.com/appcoders/mailcowtools/releases/tag/updatequota-1.0.0)
- [addSyncJobs](https://github.com/appcoders/mailcowtools/releases/tag/addsyncjobs-1.0.0)

I made them for my own use and maybe they are useful to someone else. 

I am not affiliated with mailcow in any way.
